## Programs I'm Enrolled In
- **meta back-end development on coursera:**
  Enrolling in the Meta Back-End Development program was a crucial step on my journey towards becoming a full-stack developer. This program not only provides valuable certifications but also imparts the essential skills needed to excel as a back-end developer, bridging the gap in my quest to master both front-end and back-end development.

- **work experience simulation program[jp morgan chase traders] @forage:**
  I joined the work experience simulation program with J.P. Morgan Chase to gain invaluable real-life experience as a software engineer. This program allows me to work on genuine projects that mirror the challenges and responsibilities faced by software engineers at J.P. Morgan Chase, providing me with practical insights into the world of financial technology.
  
- **full stack open:**
  The Full Stack Open course is an immersive introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. It places a strong emphasis on building single-page applications using ReactJS and harnessing REST APIs powered by Node.js. Additionally, the course explores GraphQL as a contemporary alternative to REST. Topics covered include testing, configuration, environment management, and database usage for data storage. With a credit value ranging from 5 to 14, this course mirrors the content taught in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2023. Participants also have the opportunity to engage in an associated project worth 1 to 10 credits.
